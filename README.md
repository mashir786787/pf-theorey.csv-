Data Preprocessing Notebook

This README provides an overview of the datapreprosessing.ipynb notebook, which contains Python code for data preprocessing tasks. Below are the key details:

Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is designed for performing data preprocessing. The notebook includes code cells that implement various preprocessing techniques to prepare datasets for analysis or machine learning. Common preprocessing steps may include:

Data cleaning

Feature engineering

Data transformation

Handling missing values

Scaling or normalizing features

Features

Total Cells: 26

Code Cells: 26

Markdown Cells: 0

The notebook is written in Python and uses the Python 3 kernel (base) with support for libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and others commonly used in data science.

Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.12.4 or later

Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Common Python libraries, including (but not limited to):

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn (if used for preprocessing)

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Usage

Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

jupyter notebook datapreprosessing.ipynb

Run each code cell sequentially to execute the preprocessing steps.

Modify the code as needed to fit your specific dataset or preprocessing requirements.

Notes

The notebook does not include markdown documentation or comments within the code cells. Adding markdown cells or inline comments is recommended for better understanding and maintenance.

Ensure your dataset is correctly loaded and compatible with the code.

License

This notebook is provided as-is. Feel free to modify and use it as needed for your projects.
